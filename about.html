 <h1 >Hi there!</h1>
        <p>I'm coding for a while now. Most of my free time I spending on learnign new things. JavaScript amaze me. I have finished a CIW courses which give me a basic understanding of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I start also learn JS libraries like jQuery and p5.js. Rest of my knolage I'm taking frome the internet schools like <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/emil88pl">FreeCodeCamp</a> , <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/Emil88">CodeShool</a> , <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/1158820#">SoloLearn</a> but also other websites like; <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3school</a> and if I can't find answer I use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/7595353/emil-k">StackOverFlow</a> and <a href="https://www.google.co.uk">Google</a>. I use JSON for API's you can find examples on <a href="https://codepen.io/Emil88PL/">CodePen</a> and on my <a href=" https://github.com/Emil88PL">GitHub</a> where I have some C++ samples. I was also learning some of AngularJS, PHP and Wordpress. </p><br/>
